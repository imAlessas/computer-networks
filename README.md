# Computer networks

This repo contains the scripts for the "Computer Networks" course at Universit√† degli Studi di Padova. The course is split into two main parts: HTTP and multimedia.

## HTTP

This part contains C scripts created to have a better understanding of the ```HTTP``` protocol.

## Multimedia

This part contains mostly MATLAB scripts that study how the signal behaves and how the media are transmitted between the devices.
